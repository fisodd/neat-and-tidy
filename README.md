# neat-and-tidy

Exploring neat tools in the tidyverse library for R.

These are three examples in Rmarkdown
covering some neat capabilities in
the [tidyverse](https://tidyverse.org/) of R.

* JHUcovidSmallMultiples.Rmd
  * Using the recent "pivot" functions to fixup input for a small multiples chart.
* JHUchoropleth.Rmd
  * Using "gganimate" on top of "urbnmapr" to create animated maps.
* RealtimeRt.Rmd
  * Use of "dplyr" and "purrr" features to keep order with a bunch of statistical calculations.
  
These examples are discussed in a
[blog post](https://www.fisodd.com/code/neat-and-tidy).
